# Configuration

For remote providers (Navidrome, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Spotify, NetEase, YouTube Music), the fastest path is the interactive wizard:

```sh
cliamp setup
```

It validates your credentials live and writes the right TOML block without touching the rest of your config. See [cli.md](cli.md#setup-wizard) for details.

## Config directory

cliamp resolves its config directory in this order:

- `CLIAMP_CONFIG_DIR`
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cliamp`
- `HOME/.config/cliamp`
- on Windows, `%APPDATA%\cliamp` when `HOME` is not set

The examples below use `~/.config/cliamp` for brevity. On Windows without `HOME`, replace that path with `%APPDATA%\cliamp`.

For everything else, copy the example config and edit by hand:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/cliamp
cp config.toml.example ~/.config/cliamp/config.toml
```

## Options

```toml
# Default volume in dB (range: volume_min to 6)
volume = 0

# Minimum volume floor in dB (range: -90 to 0, default: -50)
# Controls how low the volume control can go.
volume_min = -50

# Repeat mode: "off", "all", or "one"
repeat = "off"

# Start with shuffle enabled
shuffle = false

# Start with mono output (L+R downmix)
mono = false

# Restore the last listening session on launch (provider + station/playlist)
restore_last_session = true

# Initial directory for the file browser ('o' key)
initial_directory = "~/Music"

# Shift+Left/Right seek jump in seconds
seek_large_step_sec = 30

# EQ preset: "Flat", "Rock", "Pop", "Jazz", "Classical",
#             "Bass Boost", "Treble Boost", "Vocal", "Electronic", "Acoustic"
# Leave empty or "Custom" to use manual eq values below
eq_preset = "Flat"

# 10-band EQ gains in dB (range: -12 to 12)
# Bands: 70Hz, 180Hz, 320Hz, 600Hz, 1kHz, 3kHz, 6kHz, 12kHz, 14kHz, 16kHz
# Only used when eq_preset is "Custom" or empty
eq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Visualizer mode (leave empty for default Bars)
# Options: Bars, BarsDot, Rain, BarsOutline, Bricks, Columns, ClassicPeak, Wave, Scatter, Flame, Retro, Pulse, Matrix, Binary, Sakura, Firework, Bubbles, Logo, Terrain, Scope, Heartbeat, Butterfly, Ascii, Firefly, Mosaic, Sand, Geyser, ClassicLED, None
visualizer = "Bars"

# Visualizer volume linking (default: true)
# When true, bar height follows the current volume level (classic behavior).
# Set to false to decouple the visualizer from volume — bars stay visible
# even at very low volume levels.
vis_volume_linked = true

# Reduce CPU usage by lowering UI cadence and disabling visualization.
# This has the same effect as starting with --low-power.
low_power = false

# Compact mode: cap UI width at 80 columns (default: fluid/full-width)
compact = false

# UI theme name (see available themes in ~/.config/cliamp/themes/)
theme = "Tokyo Night"

# Log level: "debug", "info", "warn", or "error" (default "info")
# Logs are written to ~/.config/cliamp/cliamp.log
log_level = "info"

```

## Secrets from Environment Variables

Any string value in `config.toml` can be read from an environment variable by setting the value to `$VAR_NAME` or `${VAR_NAME}`. This keeps passwords, tokens, and client secrets out of the file itself.

```toml
[navidrome]
url = "https://music.example.com"
user = "alice"
password = "${NAVIDROME_PASSWORD}"

[plex]
url = "http://plex.local:32400"
token = "$PLEX_TOKEN"

[jellyfin]
url = "https://jelly.example.com"
token = "${JELLYFIN_TOKEN}"

[emby]
url = "https://emby.example.com"
token = "${EMBY_TOKEN}"

[ytmusic]
client_id = "${YTMUSIC_CLIENT_ID}"
client_secret = "${YTMUSIC_CLIENT_SECRET}"
```

Rules:

- Interpolation only happens when the **entire** value is `$NAME` or `${NAME}`. Mixed values like `"p@$$word"` are kept literally — no escaping needed.
- Variable names match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.
- If the variable is unset, the value is empty (the same as if you had left it blank).
- Works for any string field, including plugin config under `[plugins.<name>]`.

## Default Provider

Set which provider to start with:

```toml
provider = "radio"
```

Valid values: `radio` (default), `navidrome`, `spotify`, `plex`, `jellyfin`, `emby`, `soundcloud`, `netease`, `yt`, `youtube`, `ytmusic`.

You can also override from the CLI: `cliamp --provider jellyfin`.

## Session Restore

Save and restore your last listening session across restarts. When enabled, cliamp remembers which provider you were using and what was playing, then resumes automatically on the next launch — no CLI arguments needed.

```toml
restore_last_session = true
```

Currently supported providers: **Radio**. When you quit while listening to a radio station, cliamp saves the station URL. On restart, it switches to the Radio provider and auto-plays the same station.

Session data is saved to `~/.config/cliamp/session.json` on exit. This is separate from `resume.json`, which saves per-track playback position for seekable media (local files, podcasts).

## SoundCloud

SoundCloud is opt-in. Add the section to `~/.config/cliamp/config.toml` to register the provider:

```toml
[soundcloud]
enabled = true
```

Once enabled, search works via `Ctrl+F`, pasted SoundCloud URLs play through yt-dlp, and the empty browse view is seeded with a curated set of search-backed genre playlists (**Trending**, **Hip-Hop**, **Electronic**, **House**, **Lo-Fi**, **Indie**, **Pop**) so there's something to explore on first launch.

> SoundCloud's official charts/discover endpoints all 404 through yt-dlp at present, so cliamp can't surface real chart data anonymously. The genre playlists are search-backed (results vary in quality but reflect current uploads).

### Browse a profile

Set a username to expose that profile's tracks, likes, and reposts in the browse view:

```toml
[soundcloud]
enabled = true
user = "yourname"
```

Three playlists appear: **Tracks**, **Likes**, and **Reposts** for `soundcloud.com/yourname`. Works for any public profile.

### Sign in via browser cookies

SoundCloud closed its OAuth program in 2014, so the bring-your-own-client_id pattern Spotify uses isn't available. Instead, point yt-dlp at your existing browser session — it picks up your SoundCloud login from the browser cookie jar:

```toml
[soundcloud]
enabled = true
user = "yourname"
cookies_from = "firefox"   # or chrome, chromium, brave, edge, opera, safari, vivaldi
```

With cookies set, yt-dlp can stream subscriber-gated tracks (SoundCloud Go+) and access private likes/playlists your account is authorized for. The same cookies also apply to the player's yt-dlp invocations, so playback uses your signed-in session.

Requires `yt-dlp` on `PATH`.

## NetEase Cloud Music

NetEase is opt-in and uses your existing browser session. Sign in at `music.163.com`, then run:

```sh
cliamp setup
```

Pick **NetEase Cloud Music** and choose the browser you used to sign in. Common browsers are shown as menu choices; select the custom option only for profile-specific values. The setup wizard validates the session and writes:

```toml
[netease]
enabled = true
cookies_from = "chrome"
user_id = "your-account-user-id"
```

Once enabled, the provider shows your liked songs, created playlists, saved playlists, and public charts. Search works with `Ctrl+F`, and playback uses `yt-dlp` with the same browser cookie source.

## Built-in Radio Station

The Radio provider includes a default "cliamp radio" station (`https://radio.cliamp.stream/streams.m3u`) that is always present unless explicitly disabled.

```toml
[radio]
enable_builtin = false
```

Setting `enable_builtin = false` removes the built-in station from the provider list. User-defined stations from `radios.toml`, favorites, and catalog stations from Radio Browser are unaffected.

## Custom Radio Stations

Add your own stations to `~/.config/cliamp/radios.toml`:

```toml
[[station]]
name = "Jazz FM"
url = "https://jazz.example.com/stream"

[[station]]
name = "Ambient Radio"
url = "https://ambient.example.com/stream.m3u"
```

These appear alongside the built-in cliamp radio in the Radio provider.

See [audio-quality.md](audio-quality.md) for sample rate, buffer, bit depth, and resample quality settings.

## WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

cliamp uses ALSA for audio on Linux. WSL2 doesn't expose ALSA hardware directly, but WSLg provides a PulseAudio server that ALSA can route through.

If you see errors like `ALSA lib pcm.c: Unknown PCM default`, fix it with two steps:

**1. Install the ALSA PulseAudio plugin:**

```sh
sudo apt install libasound2-plugins
```

**2. Create `~/.asoundrc` to route ALSA through PulseAudio:**

```sh
cat > ~/.asoundrc << 'EOF'
pcm.default pulse
ctl.default pulse
EOF
```

WSLg must be active (`echo $PULSE_SERVER` should print a path). If it's empty, ensure you're on Windows 11 with WSLg enabled and run `wsl --shutdown` then reopen your terminal.

## ffmpeg (optional)

AAC, ALAC (`.m4a`), Opus, and WMA playback requires [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/):

```sh
# Arch
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

MP3, WAV, FLAC, and OGG work without ffmpeg.
